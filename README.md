# TezBox Baker Policy
To be listed as a baker within the TezBox wallet (across all platforms - Windows, MacOs, Android, iOS, Web wallet, Browser Extensions and Linux) you need to meet the following requirements:

## 1) Registration

All bakers must complete the registration form found here, and complete our standard audit. This audit targets the following:

-Your baking infrastructure
-Calrfication of your fees and payment schedules
-Assessment of the language you use when marketing

This process should take less than 48 hours, and is subject to a non-refundable 30tez fee. Completing the form and paying the fee does not automatically approve you to be listed.

## 2) Maintain a high quality service

You must continue to operate your service honestly, ensuring payments are made when promised and for the correct amounts. We will run an automated audit system that will detect any discreoincies. Small and irregular mistakes will be ignored.

If we deem that your service has not met this criteria, you will become delisted. To be lsited again, you will need to go through the registration process again, and pay the non-refundable 30tez fee as well.

Blacklisted delegates will not be allowed to register again.

## Blacklisting

We may choose to blacklist any service - blacklisted services will not be re-listed. Blacklisting can occur for the following reasons:

-Failure to pay rewards
-Exit scams

## Approved Listings

All approved bakers will be listed within the delegation section of the wallet. Bakers will be ordered in a random order. Within the TezBox wallet, bakers who are not taking in delegations (and have publicly announced this) will be moved to the bottom of the list with a warning to the user. We will also provide an indication of a bakers available capacity.

Services that require a registration process will also be marked in the app. New services will also be highlited.

## Premium Listings

Premium listings incur a monthly cost of 100tez, with a discount if paid annually (1000tez annually). Premium listings will appear at the top of the delegate list and will be display more prominently. TezBox has the following current stats:

-Over 4500 Chrome extension installs
-Over 18k unique monthly visitors to the web wallet
-Over 1000 mobile app users

Premium listing spots are limited to 10 delegates. We will also provide a link, and some performance stats for premium listings.
